Arduino code for controlling a robot hand

Using DFRobot hand and MyoWare EMGs, it is possible to control opening and closing the robot hand altogether and the index and major fingers alone (using three EMGs in this code).
Possibility to extend all five fingers individually, but requires meticulous positioning of the EMG electrodes and calibration of the thresholds associated to the activation of a single finger's signal.
